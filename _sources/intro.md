# Advanced Simulation Methods

This is a companion webpage to the MSc course on Advanced Simulation Methods taught at Imperial College London for the academic year 2024-2025. This lecture is delivered by [O. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me).

Main resources for this year will be the notes (see Blackboard) and notebooks that I will upload here.

 See [this page](https://akyildiz.me/stochastic-simulation) for the resources from my undergraduate course, which is largely relevant. See [Bayesian filtering summer course](https://akyildiz.me/ssbf-2024-intro) for some extra material on Bayesian filtering. See also my [LTCC course](https://akyildiz.me/advanced-computational-statistics/intro.html) which also has a significant overlap with this course.
